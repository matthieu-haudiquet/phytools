# Modified by Matthieu
I removed the `animation` dependency to install phytools on pasteur cluster. Most functions don't use it.

## Install

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("matthieu-haudiquet/phytools")
library(phytools)
```

# Original README

This repository contains source code, documentation, and R data for the project "phytools: Phylogenetic Tools for Comparative Biology (and Other Things)."

Please note that although comments & pull requests are welcome, those not involving an actual software bug (which I always try to fix as promptly as I can) may not be addressed in a timely manner.
